# Exercise: Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. When people talk to him, his responses
are pretty limited. Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to
someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

-   "Sure." This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How
    are you?" The convention used for questions is that it ends with a
    question mark.
-   "Whoa, chill out!" This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM. The
    convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
-   "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!" This is what he says if you yell
    a question at him.
-   "Fine. Be that way!" This is how he responds to silence. The
    convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of
    whitespace characters.
-   "Whatever." This is what he answers to anything else.

## Tip

You might want to take a look at the [built-in string methods][].

## Extra

-   Make it so it is possible to say or ask multiple things to Bob
    without having to execute the program again. (The [`while`
    statement][] might be useful.)
-   Add unit tests to your program using the built-in [`unittest`
    module][].
